    <p>This one goes through a chain of 301 and 302 redirects. Some try to set ETag headers.</p>
    <p>There's definitely some caching going on, but I can't discern the pattern. But no ETags seem to be sent in the request.</p>
    <p>Is the browser just transparently caching and skipping requests? From the server logs that seems to be the case.</p>
