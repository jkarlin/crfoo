# Fenced Frames Demo

This directory holds a demo site for testing features of fenced frames. The
entry point for this demo is `index.php`. From there, you can select a test
page to load from the dropdown, and then create a frame with that page using
the buttons below.

To add a new test page, create a `.php` file in the `content/` folder. Store
any helper scripts in a `.js` file with the same name. Then add the `.php`
filename as an `option` in `index.php`.
